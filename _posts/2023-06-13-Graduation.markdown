Today is June 13th, 2023. I'm writing this from my University's library in midst of finals week. Unlike the hundreds of other students around me who are furiously cramming for their finals, this is my first low-stress finals week. Although my classes weren't necessarily easy, my finals week was especially light because none of my classses had finals save for my take-home final for my econometrics class which I turned in yesterday. None of that is really important except for the fact that its given me an ungodly amount of time to reflect on the past three years as all of my friends are busy studying.

I'm seven days away from commencement and only two projects away from being done with all of my undergraduate coursework. The immenent threat of graduation doesn't feel especially surreal, although I am feeling a lot of uncertainty despite having the next couple years of my life mapped out. However, it does feel like time keeps speeding up. High school graduation felt like it was yesterday. I can also distinctly remember moving into my dormroom freshman year, attending my first zoom class, and meeting my first friends in college. The rest of college has kind of felt like a blur although I suppose that isn't necessarily a bad thing. I think without the photos saved on my camera-roll and in snapchat, it probably wouldn't take much to convince me that college only lasted one year instead of three. That’s not to say that college has not been an absolute blast. I’ve had more fun and met more friends than any other time in my entire life, and can honestly say I’ve become a much better person than I was when I started college. Although there were plenty of bright spots, I don’t think I can say it was the happiest three years of my life. But I think there were some benefits to that. It made me think plenty about what I wanted to do in my future, what things I needed to learn, and most motivated me to do a lot of things I probably otherwise would not have. 

I’m trying to keep this blog as a place for general reflection and also any academic interests I have, so the rest of this blog post might come across as a little boring. The purpose of this specific post is to compile my thoughts about whether what I have learned  in the classroom at college is valuable, and why it may help me down the road.
